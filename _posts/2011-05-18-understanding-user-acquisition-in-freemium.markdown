<p class="quiet">This is the model I found when writing my Master's
thesis on freemium. This is mainly here to get feedback from my
respondents, but I would love feedback even if you're not a respondent —
just <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#064;&#107;&#105;&#109;&#106;&#111;&#097;&#114;&#046;&#110;&#101;&#116;">send me an email</a>.</p>

I've had 10 interviews with companies using freemium, primarily focusing
on how these companies acquire users. What I found when analyzing my
interviews, is that there seems to be a similar process in how
freemium-based companies aquire new users and customers. I've divided
this process into three "loops". I'll start with going through each
loop, and then putting it all together at the end.

I would love feedback on the model. Do you see things differently? If
so, what? Are then any areas that are particularly lacking? Or do you
agree with the model?

The User Acquisition Loop
-------------------------

How freemium-based companies aquire new users and thus build its
userbase can be seen as a loop. This loop consist of four elements:

1. **Potential and Existing Users.** First of all, the market must be
   big. If it's not a very big market opportunity, the chance of success
   with freemium is very small, as most likely only a single digit
   percentage of users will convert to pay. As one of the respondents
   said:

   > If you're going to build a meaningful revenue base, you need to
   > have a very large user base to start with. It only works with very
   > large market segments and market opportunities.

   According to another, "the standard wisdom is that you'll see 2-3%
   conversion rate in the consumer internet, 5% or perhaps a bit higher
   on business users, prosumers." Thus, if the market is not big enough
   it will be very difficult to get enough paying customers. One
   respondents explained it as "most consumers don't pay for any web
   app."

   Second, from the interviews there is a clear notion that successfully
   having free users using the product or service relies on having a
   *culture of free* — that is, fully accepting that potential and
   existing users may not now or even ever pay for your product or
   service. Thus, it is about seeing value in free users. As one of the
   respondents said that "you will by definition get less serious
   signups --- I think that's kind of a given," while another similarly
   says that "there is an inverse relationship to cost and churn." One
   explained it as follows:

   > There's not a lot of established companies that understand that
   > it's not just a "we'll put it on our website, we'll do a little bit
   > of email marketing, and then people understand it and start to use
   > it and convert."

   In total, this step is about finding the right user and fully
   accepting that most of these users will never pay for your product or
   service.

2. **Add Value.** The free version *must* have considerable value.
   Freemium is about using the product as marketing, and thus, if the
   users don't get any value from it, you will see a very low amount of
   conversion. As one respondent said: "It begins and ends with great
   product. The product is the marketing, and that's why you have a free
   version." One respondent says that an incontrovertible offer is
   needed --- this is what "will get the initial people in the door."
   Similarly another said:

   > The free version can be thought of as a trial version of the
   > product, it gives you enough to understand what you can do, and
   > then a lot of the upgrade features are showcased but must be paid
   > for to access.

   According to one respondent: "We'll get a bigger return and we'll get
   a bigger brand affiliation if the people who are using the freemium
   offer are actually getting something of significant value."

   But this value is however not only about the product itself, as one
   respondent explains:

   > And the product is not just about what the user experience is
   > online, it's the whole package. It goes back to the importance of
   > loving your users, giving them massive hand holding and support.
   > That whole experience is really key to building a large engaged
   > user base.

   Thus, adding value is also about building a relationship with the
   users, not just letting them use a product or service for free.

3. **Customer Engagement.** Word-of-mouth is the nucleus of freemium.
   Without engaged user, there will be no WOM, and without WOM there
   will be no business. As one respondent said: "word-of-mouth was
   paramount, without it we wouldn't exist."

   Word-of-mouth was mentioned as key by all respondents. As one
   clarifies about WOM:

   > That's one of the prerequisites I think you need for a freemium
   > model. If you are giving something away for free, and are looking
   > to covert 1, 2, 10, 20% of those guys to paid, if they are not
   > telling other people or they are not taking something they use at
   > home to work, then subsidizing that free use is not worth the time.

   One of the respondents call these engaged users "word-of-mouth
   agents":

   > Now 18 months later we've got an army of over 100 000 people that
   > have signed up, and we have word-of-mouth agents that feel somewhat
   > indebted to our organization because they've got such a good deal.
   > And they've become word-of-mouth agents for our brand.

   Another respondent uses the term "goodwill" to describe this phenomena:

   > With us they can use it for free forever, and that goodwill gets
   > people talking. When that promoter star goes up we expand in the
   > community.

   Several of the respondents mention that they have not done any
   traditional marketing at all, they have mostly focused on
   word-of-mouth and the products own virality. However, the more mature
   the company, the more traditinonal marketing was a part of the mix.

   Another aspect that was mentioned by many of the respondents is that
   it is important that the company is focused on a vocal niche,
   especially in the beginning. Without a vocal niche it
   is very difficult to get existing users to get new users in. One
   respondent said:

   > You've got to be focused, you've got to have a very defined,
   > interconnected group of prospects that talk.

   The respondent also said:

   > If you deliver a product that benefits people in \[our chosen\]
   > community, there are so many channels where people will talk about
   > it, both online and face-to-face, that you can get pretty wide in
   > that community in a matter of weeks and months rather than quarters
   > and years.

   To get the word going in this vocal niche, the respondents talk about
   different strategies, but there is a strong focus on creating "viral
   loops", e.g. as explained by on respondent: "if there's a viral loop
   that's baked into your product, then \[the free users\] are adding to
   your user base because they're helping attract new users." According
   to him, virality is one of the key aspects of free users.

   Another respondent go as far as stating that "anything that promotes
   virality should be free to keep your viral flow going," and adds:

   > Don’t inhibit your own virality by limiting usage of the product in
   > silly ways that don’t actually cost you anything --- most costs in
   > a SaaS business are marginal when it comes to usage.

   One of the clear upsides of building in this virality is in customer
   acquisition. One respondent talks about how they have done very little
   to acquire customers, as every user that use their tool end up
   "telling 10s, 100s or 1000s of others about" it. And this is from a
   company that sell to several Fortune 500 companies without having a
   sales team at all.

4. **Simple Choice.**
   This is explained very good by one respondent:

   > You've got to have a product that is easy \[...\] to understand. It's
   > got to be easy to understand, easy to become aware, easy to get
   > started and using it, easy to gain value, and then easy to talk
   > about it. Those are really paramount.

   There are several core elements of creating this simple choice: that
   the product is free is, of course, one of them. Another is that there
   must evident value in the free version to get people to try it out. A
   part of this is also just to "minimize friction". As one respondent
   says: "avoiding feature creep is critical, only expose things that
   are relevant for at least 80% of your audience."

   According to one respondent, as the attention span of most users are
   very short it is important in freemium to have an awereness-to-use
   benefit measured in minutes. One relates this to free trials:

   > Free trial is also an interesting model, but it typically requires
   > a credit card up front, and can scare off consumers unnecessarily
   > --- you end up with more qualified leads, but much less volume.

   We can see another perspective on this from another respondent.
   According to him, when they created their product they had the
   following goal: "We do one thing, and we do it better than anyone in
   the world, and we are going to do it better than anyone for the rest
   of our lives."

   What this *simple choice* entails seems to be very different from
   case to case. Some want the hurdle to be as low as possible, others
   want a somewhat larger hurdle to "\[weed\] out the free-riders that
   always want to get something for nothing." The point is to create a
   simple choice for the users you *want* to get in. Here we see an
   interesting perspective from one respondent who had failed in their
   use of freemium:

   > If you had just encountered our website — just stumbled across it —
   > you had not known what on earth you'd use it for.

   The respondent also said: "We had so much complex functionality that
   needed to be explained." For the companies that have had success with
   freemium, there seemed to be a strong focus on simplicity. As one
   respondent summarized: "make a simple product that is easy to use."

   So what we end up with, is that the difference between this step and
   *Add value*, is that this is about making the choice to test your
   product or service as simple as possible. It is about enticing user
   to try it out. And as one respondent said it, there should be "no
   risk for the user."

So to summarize this loop: You have some users, you give a lot of value
for free, you get them engaged, and they get other people interested, so
you have to make it dead easy for these new users to get in and start
using your service. This builds your userbase larger, and the loop
continues.

The Learning Loops
------------------

To successfully use freemium it is essential to learn from existing and
potential users. For many this involves being obsessed with metrics, but
for others this is mainly about being focused on having a relationship
with the users from who one can learn about how they view the product.
The learning loop is about learning what works, what doesn't work, and
also about getting ideas and thoughts from the userbase. As one
respondent says:

> We're looking for quick reach, looking for basically more customers,
> more insights, we want more people to tell us "We like your
> applications because of X, we don't like them because of Y."

The reason this step is very important in addition to the user
acquisition loop, is because "everyone has a different journey of
freemium." It is about seeing where customers get value, and finding out
what they are willing to pay for and how much. Especially one respondent
had a story about one of their features:

> People would tell us "we would pay $100 a month for this feature", so
> we rolled it out at $100 a month, as an addon to our regular plans.
> And it sold, but it didn't sell like we thought it would. But it was a
> lot of desire to protect that, because it seemed to be valuable, so we
> kind of dragged our feet. But we eventually rolled that into our
> plans, and we forgot about it being an addon. We decided that this had
> high perceived value, but the packaging that people said that they
> wanted, they didn't actually want based on their bahaviour. So we
> rolled it into all our plans, and we created a new plan that was one
> step up from our low-end plan that included it. This increased all our
> numbers. So, we were afraid that we would have a loss in terms of
> revenue, but we have had a significant uptick in quantities of
> conversion each month based on rolling in a feature that we thought
> was valuable on its own.

The general knowledge seems to be that freemium is a "numbers game", and
as it is far more opaque than regular payment models, having a deep
knowledge and understanding about the users and how they behave is
critical. According to one respondent it is "very easy to build a
non-profitable business." He also state:

> we know exactly how much the average free user cost us to serve over
> the lifetime, we know, on average, how long it takes us, and how much
> it costs us, to convert them into a paid user, we know how much it
> cost to serve them as a paid user, we know with pretty good certainty
> how long the will stick around before they churn out. So that's cost
> of acquisition, cost to serve, and how much revenue we will extract
> from that period is what lifetime value it adds up to be.

One of the reasons this is important is, as one state:

> There's room for permutations. We didn't have a formulae. We just
> experimented. That's how we found out what works for us. It's just
> trial and error.

This learning is about finding and improving the *right* value for the
target customers, and finding the right way to create a simple choice to
get the user in.

The Conversion Loop
-------------------

And then the final step — conversion. And let us start with the obvious:
There is no golden rule. On the one side respondents stated that "most
users that will upgrade typically do so fairly quickly," while on the
other side respondents stated that "there is a very long customer life
cycle — a person might be a free user for 18 months before they
convert." Generally the focus seemed to be more on the latter than the
former — and thus implying that conversion usually is based on
experiencing the product or service. As one said: "you need to have a
way to keep people engaged."

One of the most important elements to get right in this step is finding
the right balance between free and paid. As one of the respondents who
had failed with freemium stated: "\[the free users\] didn't understand why
they needed the paid offering." Especially one respondent had an
interesting view on this. They had decided that they wanted to go for a
10% conversion rate, and they were very focused on not nagging at all
the free users to convert:

> So I always look at "how do I do it so that I don't bother 90% of
> people, but it really resonates with the 10% that I think can be paid
> users?"

Two things that the respondents were very similar with regards to, were
first to have a clear upgrade path, or as one said, "just kind of a
natural progression of things where you start paying them," and second
that value-based pricing, instead of cost-based, is the way to go.

Putting It All Together
-----------------------

Putting these three elements together, we get the following model:

Based on this, we can say that the value of free users is in driving the
user acquisition loop — I call it crowdsourced user acquisition — and in
being the basis of the learning loops and the conversion loop.
