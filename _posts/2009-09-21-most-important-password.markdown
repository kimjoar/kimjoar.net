title: My most important password
---

Today I realized it doens't matter how much I focus on my passwords for different services as long as my GMail password is not _as_ secure as them. The moment my GMail password is less secure, that is the easiest point of entry, and from there you can get access to most other services I use, by utilizing their lost password functionality.

Lately I have been an avid user of [1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password), so I now have different passwords for most services, and I also use a length of 16 to 20 characters in each password. This makes most of my services reasonably secure, but the problem is that the passwords are difficult to remember.

For the services I need to be able to access while away from my MacBook Pro I have to memorize their password's. Not so easy, I tell you. So I ended up not changing my GMail password. Until today, when I actually gave my password habits a thought.

So the important lesson is to see which services are most important to secure and focus on them first. Then you can go on an secure everything else.
